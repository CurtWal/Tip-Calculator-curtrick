Progress Report #1 Monday June 27, 2022

What progress have you made for your project so far?
- I have finished everything just adding css style to my document.

Are there any challenges you have / have faced? How will you / did you overcome them?
- I would say the only challenge that I had was first finding out where to start since there wasn't really instructions on where to start. I wouldn't say I over came that challenge as i'm pretty sure on the next assignment I may run into the same problem. But if I were to overcome it I should just start with the basic structure of the assignment I have to create.

Are there any other questions you have for your instructors?
- Non that I can think of right now

Are there any concepts you are not so familiar with?
- I can remember everything after awhile but somethings just take longer to come to mind like adding text from javascript into html.


Progress Report #2 Tuesday June 28, 2022

What progress have you made for your project so far?

I believe I am done now I had to go back from yesterdays work and add a reset button and add/ do some playing around with css styling to get the page looking somewhat good.

Are there any challenges you have / have faced? How will you / did you overcome them?

- I didn't have any problems on todays work other then just searching google to learn how to setup a reset button but that was pretty easy. But other than just trying to figure out where to start I feel like thats just something that will go away over time as I do more and more coding.

Are there any other questions you have for your instructors?

- Non so far

Are there any concepts you are not so familiar with?

- Mostly familar with all the concepts we went over just need to practice more with them.
